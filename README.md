# [JStebeat](https://butterroach.github.io/jstebeat/)

Online bytebeat player with some examples

Inspired by [SthephanShi's](https://www.dollchan.net/bytebeat) and [psubscirbe's](https://psubscirbe-bytebeat.neocities.org/) players, but not forked from any player.
Planned to be made with vanilla Javascript.
