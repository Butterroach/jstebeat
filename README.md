# jstebeat

Online bytebeat player with some examples

Inspired by [SthephanShi's](https://www.dollchan.net/bytebeat) and [psubscirbe's](https://psubscirbe-bytebeat.neocities.org/) players, but not forked from any player.
Planned to be made with vanilla Javascript.

NOTE: This player seems to hate arrays for some reason?

\(if you see this repo on my github profile congratulate me because i have overcome my laziness\)
