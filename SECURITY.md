# Security Policy of JStebeat

We care about security very much, and we strive to protect our users from vulnerabilities.

If you find a security vulnerability, please kindly refer to the following easy-to-follow guide:

## "It's a client-side XSS"

Not a security concern. Fuck off.

## "It's something to do with the server-side"

You're making shit up. Fuck off.

## "You leaked your certs"

No I didn't. Those (in the `cert` dir) aren't my certs. Those are testing certs. Fuck off.

## "...but... server si-"

Oh? What's that? FUCK. OFF.

## "but client side xss... code execution attack on the v8-"

Report that shit to Chrome. Not me. I did nothing. And fuck off.

## "I have something else that's not actually bullshit (and I know what I'm doing)"

Contact me:

    - butterroach <at> proton <dot> me (way slower response times, prefer outlook please)
- Reddit: u <slash> butterroach (slower than main email, faster than alt email)

I have **NO OTHER** active forms of communication. And if you just lied, fuck off.
